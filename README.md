## Configuration

### Data Directory
```
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\PowerShell\WorkMode\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ time-tracking.json    # Session history and statistics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work-sites.json       # Website block lists
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config\              # Configuration files
```

### Module Directory
```
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\WorkMode\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WorkMode.psm1        # Main module file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WorkMode.psd1        # Module manifest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hostess.exe          # Hostess binary
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config\              # Configuration files
```

### Default Blocked Sites
- **Social Media**: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, Snapchat
- **Entertainment**: YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, Imgur, TikTok
- **Gaming**: Steam, Epic Games, Discord
- **Forums**: Reddit

## How It Works

1. **WorkMode**: Blocks distracting websites using hostess, starts work timer
2. **NormalMode**: Unblocks websites, starts break timer
3. **Manual Control**: You decide when to switch modes - no automatic changes
4. **Time Tracking**: Each mode switch creates a session with start/end times
5. **Statistics**: View work vs normal time percentages and productivity insights

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Administrator privileges (for hosts file modification)
- Windows hosts file access

## Troubleshooting

**Permission Denied Errors**
- Run PowerShell as Administrator for website blocking
- Check if your antivirus blocks hosts file modification

**"Blocked 0 distracting websites" Issue**
- This was a bug in the counting logic and has been fixed
- If you still see this issue, use `wmh-update` to ensure you have the latest version
- The blocking was working correctly, only the count display was affected

**Corrupted Session State**
- If WorkMode gets stuck in an inconsistent state, use the force parameter:
  ```powershell
  wmh-on -Force   # Force enable WorkMode
  wmh-off -Force  # Force disable WorkMode
  ```

**Hostess Binary Issues**
- Use `wmh-update` to download the latest binary
- Ensure `hostess.exe` is in the module directory
- If hostess commands fail with "invalid command", try updating the binary

**Profile Integration Issues**
- Verify you've added the integration code to your `$PROFILE`
- Run `. $PROFILE` to reload your profile after changes

## Advanced Usage

### Debugging and Recovery

The `-Force` parameter is useful for debugging and recovery scenarios:

```powershell
# Force enable WorkMode (bypasses state checks)
wmh-on -Force

# Force disable WorkMode (bypasses state checks)
wmh-off -Force

# Use when:
# - Session state becomes corrupted
# - WorkMode gets stuck in an inconsistent state
# - You need to bypass normal validation for debugging
```

**When to use Force parameter:**
- When WorkMode shows incorrect current mode
- After system crashes or unexpected shutdowns
- When session data becomes corrupted
- For debugging and testing purposes

### Custom Block Lists
```powershell
# Add multiple sites
"distracting1.com", "distracting2.com" | ForEach-Object {
    wmh-add $_
}

# Export your block list
Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\WorkMode\work-sites.json" |
    ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 |
    Set-Content "my-block-list.json"
```

### Data Analysis
```powershell
# View raw session data
$data = Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\WorkMode\time-tracking.json" |
    ConvertFrom-Json

$totalWorkTime = ($data.Sessions | Where-Object { $_.Mode -eq "Work" } |
    Measure-Object -Property DurationHours -Sum).Sum

Write-Host "Total work hours: $totalWorkTime"
```
