## Configuration

### Data Directory
WorkMode stores all data in:
```
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\PowerShell\WorkMode\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ time-tracking.json    # Session history and statistics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work-sites.json       # Website block lists
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config\              # Configuration files
```

### Default Blocked Sites
The system comes with pre-configured blocking for:

- **Gaming**: Steam, Epic Games, Discord
- **Forums**: Reddit

### Customizing Block Lists

```powershell
# Add custom distracting sites
add-block-site instagram.com
add-block-site tiktok.com

# View all blocked sites
show-block-sites

# Remove sites you don't want blocked
remove-block-site linkedin.com  # if you need LinkedIn for work
```

## How It Works

### Mode Switching
1. **WorkMode**: Blocks distracting websites using hostess, starts work timer
2. **NormalMode**: Unblocks websites, starts break timer
3. **Manual Control**: You decide when to switch modes - no automatic changes

### Time Tracking
- Each mode switch creates a new session
- Sessions are tracked with start/end times and duration
- Data is stored in JSON format for easy analysis
- Statistics show work vs normal time percentages

### Website Blocking
- Uses **hostess** utility to manage Windows hosts file
- Sites are redirected to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
- Blocking is toggled on/off (sites remain in hosts file)
- Requires administrator privileges for hosts file modification

## Productivity Insights

### Statistics Dashboard
`work-stats` provides:

- **Overall Statistics**: Total work/normal time, productivity percentage
- **Today's Stats**: Current day's work/break time breakdown
- **Weekly Overview**: This week's productivity trends
- **Current Session**: Active session duration and mode

### Productivity Tips
The system provides insights based on your patterns:
- **70%+ work time**: "Excellent focus! You're maintaining great work habits."
- **50-70% work time**: "Good balance between work and breaks."
- **Below 50% work time**: "Consider increasing focus time for better productivity."
