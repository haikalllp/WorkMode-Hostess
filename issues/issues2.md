wmh-uninstall does not clear backup files created by -Repair in installation

wmh-uninstall should automatically reload profile

wmh-stats is not working and session is not properly tracked

current wmh is not preserved upon close of terminal session? so if current in work, closed terminal re-open it thinks no wmh session was started, but hostess properly disabled/blocks the sites.

turns out all sessions is not being tracked at all and stats doesnt work for them
